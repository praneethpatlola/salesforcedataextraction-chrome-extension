# Airtable LinkedIn Contact Importer

This is a Chrome Extension that runs on the LinkedIn profile pages and allows to import some of the profile data to a given 'Contacts' table on [Airtable](http://www.airtable.com).

I have built this because LinkedIn has closed their API (not cool!) and decided to switch to [Airtable](http://www.airtable.com) to manage my contact list (personal CRM).

This an alpha version and requires a specific field format in the Contacts table. So it's unlikely you can use it just out of the box :)
